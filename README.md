# Square Root of a Complex Number

## Project Description

This is a C++program computes the square root of a complex number `(a + bi)` 
by solving the equations **a = x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup>** and **b = 2xy**. 
The program prompts the user to input the real and imaginary parts of the complex number 
and then calculates the roots.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input a complex number in the form `a + bi`.
- Computes the real and imaginary parts of the square root of the complex number.
- Validates the input to ensure it is a complex number (i.e., `b` is not zero).
- Outputs the computed roots of the complex number.
- Provides a back-check to verify the computed solution.
